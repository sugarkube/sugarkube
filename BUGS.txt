# Known bugs
* Sugarkube uses 100% of CPU when waiting on tasks to complete. Profiling confirms there are no inefficiencies in our code. It appears to be due to https://github.com/golang/go/issues/27707
* Run unit key names declared in the main sugarkube-conf.yaml file must be lowercase because Viper automatically lowercases all key (https://github.com/spf13/viper/pull/635)
