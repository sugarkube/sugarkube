# Sugarkube

**Sugarkube is an orchestrator** that lets you create [ephemeral Kubernetes clusters](https://docs.sugarkube.io/introduction/ephemeral-clusters/). With only a few commands you can **launch and configure a Kubernetes cluster**, install all your applications into it and create any required infrastructure. This lets you spin up and tear down clusters on-demand which is [incredibly powerful](https://docs.sugarkube.io/#benefits-of-sugarkube). **Sugarkube lets you automate the creation of Kubernetes clusters 100%**. That includes setting up your cloud accounts (e.g. creating S3 buckets, encryption keys, DNS, etc.) and tearing it all down when you're done.

For more information see the [complete documentation](https://docs.sugarkube.io).
